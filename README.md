# ORDUM-CLI
Experimental ORDUM CLI application for command-line users 

This application is for command-line lovers and enthuast who do not want to leave the terminal and just apply for the grants.

**Current Limitation facing**
* Cannot target contract events, only targeting pallet events
* Cannot interact with Phala Queries using subxt as no docs provided for offchain api

**MOTTO**

*Focus on the terminal and get the work done !!!*
